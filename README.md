# Nyaadle
A small rss parser and downloader for a certain cat-themed website.

## How it works
Nyaadle connects to the cat-themed website and compares it to a watch-list you providw.
If a match is found, it grabs the link and downloads it to a specified folder.

## Future Plans
This program is currently setup for a single website. But future releases might support 
whatever website that have an rss feed you wish to download from.
